## Project Details

This project involves the development and deployment of a **Soroban Token Contract** on the Stellar Testnet. The contract allows the creation of a custom token with various functionalities such as minting, transferring, and burning tokens, along with features like freezing and unfreezing accounts.

### Key features of this project include:
- **Token creation** with customizable properties (name, symbol, decimals).
- **Minting and burning tokens** functionality.
- **Transfer functions** for token transactions.
- **Administrative control features** (freeze/unfreeze accounts).
- Designed for deployment on the **Stellar network**.
- **Contract Address**: CA6A5ON7CR5RAVFCEBLGQHJAISJKV6ICP5UNEPMXWGNSBYSBIGLDFPZV
### **Newly Added: Total Supply feature**

This feature allows for the **total supply** of the token to be set, ensuring a fixed or adjustable number of tokens. This addition provides more control over the token's circulation.

## Vision

The **Soroban Token Contract** is designed to empower decentralized applications by providing them with a flexible and secure token management system. With this contract, developers can create custom tokens that cater to their specific needs, allowing the creation of decentralized economies and ecosystems. The vision for this project is to make blockchain technology more accessible and to contribute to the wider adoption of decentralized financial systems.

## Software Development Plan

1. **Smart Contract Development**:
   - Develop the Soroban token contract with key functions such as `mint`, `transfer`, `burn`, and `freeze/unfreeze`.
   - Implement token creation with customizable parameters like token name, symbol, and decimals.
   
2. **Frontend Development**:
   - (If applicable) Create a user-friendly frontend for interacting with the contract.
   - Provide easy-to-use features like wallet integration and token transactions.
   
3. **Testing**:
   - Deploy the contract to the Stellar Testnet and thoroughly test all functionalities.
   - Ensure that functions like `mint`, `transfer`, `burn`, and `freeze/unfreeze` work as expected.
   
4. **Security**:
   - Perform a security audit on the smart contract to ensure it is safe from exploits.
   
5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the Soroban Token Contract to the Stellar network.
   - Provide instructions for users to interact with the contract via a web interface or command-line tools.
